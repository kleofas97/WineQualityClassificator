# WineQualityClassificator
Script developed for looking for the best classifier for wine quality predictor. Based on kaggle implementation: https://www.kaggle.com/vishalyo990/prediction-of-quality-of-wine

Hi this is the first uploaded version of wine quliaty calssifier, based on dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/

For running the code please download the repository, install necesarry modules and run the "Winko.py" script.

In the future, I plan to prepare software to classify it by quality scale and not just binary as It is now. 

For nor (may 2020) F1 score for best algirthm (Decision Tree) for predicting "bad wine" is more than 90% and for "good wine" around 65%.

Feel free to use it.
